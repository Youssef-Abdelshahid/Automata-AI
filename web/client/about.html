      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We believe that powerful AI should run everywhere, from the smallest
        microcontrollers to industrial IoT devices. Our mission is to
        eliminate the complexity and expertise barriers that prevent
        developers from deploying AI on resource-constrained hardware.

        <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
        <p>
          Developing AI models for embedded systems traditionally requires deep
          expertise in machine learning, hardware optimization, and embedded
          systems programming. Engineers face numerous challenges including
          model size constraints, limited computational resources, power
          consumption requirements, and the need for specialized knowledge in
          quantization, pruning, and hardware-specific optimizations.

        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Automata AI provides an end-to-end automated platform that takes your
          dataset and hardware specifications, then generates optimized,
          production-ready models. Our intelligent system handles model
          architecture selection, training, quantization, optimization, and
          packaging automatically.
